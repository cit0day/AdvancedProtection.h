# Advanced Anti-Debugging Techniques

This header file provides advanced anti-debugging and anti-cracking techniques for use in C++ projects.

## Features

- Detection of common debuggers and debugger windows
- Hardware breakpoints detection
- Output debug string detection
- NtQueryInformationProcess detection
- PEB Being Debugged flag detection
- Timing discrepancies detection
- Software breakpoints detection
- Cheat Engine driver detection
- x64dbg driver detection
- Detection of drivers associated with specific programs
- Self-debugging mechanism

## Usage

Include the `AdvancedAntiDebug.h` header file in your C++ project to use these anti-debugging techniques.

```cpp
#include "AdvancedAntiDebug.h"

int main() {
    if (PerformAntiDebugChecks()) {
        // Debugger detected, take appropriate action
        return 1;
    }
    // No debugger detected, continue execution
    return 0;
}
